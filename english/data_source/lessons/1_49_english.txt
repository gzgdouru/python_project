Do you want any meat today, Mrs.Brid?
Yes, please.
Do you want beef or lamb.
Beef, please.
This lamb's very good.
I like lamb, but my husband doesn't.
What about some steak? This is a nice piece.
Give me that piece, please.
And a pound of mince, too.
Do you want a chicken, Mrs.Brid? They're very nice.
No, thank you.
My husband likes steak, but he doesn't like chicken.
To tell you the truth, Mrs.Brid, I don't like chicken either!
