What are you doing, Carol?
I'm making a shopping list, Tom.
What do we need?
We need a lot of things this week.
I must go to the grocer's. We haven't got much tea or coffee, and we haven't got any sugar or jam.
What about vegetable?
I must go to the greengrocer's. We haven't got many tomatos, but we've got a lot of potatos.
I must go to the butcher's, too. We need some meat. We haven't goy any meat at all.
Have we got any beer and wine?
No, we haven't. And I'm not going to get any!
I hope that you've got some money.
I haven't got much.
Well. I haven't got much either!
