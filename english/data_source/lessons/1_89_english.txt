Good afternoon. I believe that this house is for sale.
That's right.
May I have a look at it, please?
Yes, of course. Come in.
How long have you lived here?
I've lived here twenty years.
Twenty years! That's a long time.
Yes, I've been there since 1976.
Then why do you want to sell it?
Because I've just retired. I want to buy a small house in the country.
How much does this house cost?
68500 pound.
That's a lot of money!
It's worth every penny of it.
Well, I like the house, but I can decide yet. My wife must see it first.
Women always have the last word.
