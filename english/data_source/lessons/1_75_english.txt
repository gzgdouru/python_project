Do you have any shoes like these?
What size?
Size five.
What color?
Black.
I'm sorry. We don't have any.
But my sister bought this pair last month.
Did she buy them here?
No, she bought them in the U.S.
We had some shoes like thoes a month ago, but we don't have any now.
Can you get a pair for me, please?
I'm afraid that I can't. They were in fashion last year and the year before last. But they're not in fashion this year.
These shoes are in fashion now.
They look very uncomfortable.
They are very uncomfortable. But women always wear uncomfortable shoes!
