Hello, Ken.
Hi, George.
Have you just been to the cinema?
Yes, I have.
What's on?
'Paris in the Spring'.
Oh, I've already seen it. I saw it on television last year. It's an old film, but it's very good.
Paris is a beautiful city.
I've never been there. Have you ever been there, Ken?
Yes, I have. I was there in April.
Paris in the Spring, eh?
It was Spring, but the weather was awful. It rained all the time.
Just like London!
